# My random scripts
I write a lot of random one-off scripts to do various tasks that don't really fit into another repo. This is their home.

# Scripts
* essay_amino_translate.py: translates ASCII text into a series of amino acid tags
* code-challenge-descriptions: descriptions of various code challenges I've ran
* code-challenge-X-solution: my solution to the given code challenge in code-challenge-descriptions
* perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be: python script to check .csproj files for duplicate includes
