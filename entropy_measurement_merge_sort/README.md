# The deterministic anti-sorting algorithm challenge

## The task
Your task is to create an anti-sorting algorithm that takes a perfectly sorted
list and returns a list that is as unsorted/has as much entropy as possible.

We define a list's entropy as the average of how much effort it takes for
`bubble_sort`, `insertion_sort`, and `selection_sort` to sort it. These
algorithms are defined in `sort.py`.

Your algorithm must be _deterministic_, which means that when I run your
algorithm to judge it, it should return the same list each time.

Your algorithm should take in a CSV of a perfectly sorted list and output a CSV
of an unsorted list. An example of the CSV format I'm expecting is provided via
`test.csv` and `sort.py`. I recommend testing your program with `sort.py`.


## Submitting
Submit a link to your source code. Please include build instructions for Linux.

If you make me build it on Windows, I'll hate you. But I'll do it. I can't
guarantee that your timing results will be the same, though, because I'm
measuring runtime with the Linux utility `time`, which may or may not run the
same way on Linux for Windows as it does on pure Linux. So please do make every
effort to build your program on Linux, for your own sake.

If your program doesn't compile/I have trouble building it, I'll reach out to you.


## Winning
You will be judged on 3 metrics:

1. Speed: Your program will be timed on how long it takes to generate its list.
   This will be measured with the Linux utility `time`.
2. Correctness: Your generated list will be run through `sort.py`. More
   effort is better.
3. Coolness: Each program will be voted on how rad it is by the office.

Every algorithm will be tested against the same, randomly-generated sorted list
of 10,000 numbers.

You get mega bonus points to all three categories if you provide a proof that
your algorithm results in the highest possible entropy, but none of you jokers
are actually going to do it so whatever.

Whoever wins the most categories will get a $15 gift card to Qdoba or Jimmy John's or
something smh


## Tips
... Look, I tested it, and just reversing merge sort doesn't work. So don't just
do that. You'll lose coolness points too, anyways.
